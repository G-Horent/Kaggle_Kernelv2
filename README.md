# Kaggle_Kernel

## Ideas of improvements and developments

### Kernels

- try random walk kernel
- try WL subtree, shortest path
- try RBF on features

- (try shortest path ?)

### Learning

- SVC
- Logistic regression
- try PCA then classification (maybe bad idea)

### Data

- see whether we should remove some data from the training. (Particularly, see if there are problematic data in the test set. Try submissions with or without).

### Other

- look at the optional slides
